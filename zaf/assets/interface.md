# zaf: the interface

One binary for every step of the work. Run every verb from the project root, the
directory that holds `ZAF.toml`. Output is terse; `--json` gives structured output
and `--more` gives depth.

Exit codes, the same for every verb:
- `0` done.
- `1` refused by the state: not ready, held by another instance, your batch is full,
  a must-fix finding, a failed acceptance line, a malformed ask.
- `2` a backend failed or is missing, a step failed or timed out, or the command
  line is malformed.
- `64` listed but not built yet: stop that step and say so in your report; never
  work around it.

The environment the verbs read (the spawner sets both; by hand, set them yourself):
- `ZAF_INSTANCE`: who you are, as `<role> instance <n> on #<epic>`. `board claim`
  and `board report` exit 2 without it; `brief` and `ask` use `local`.
- `ZAF_VERSION`: the release your branches build toward, for `{version}` in the
  branch patterns.

| Verb | Use it to |
|---|---|
| `zaf board ready` | list the tasks open for a claim; `--json` gives each one's epic |
| `zaf board claim <task>` | claim a task under a lease |
| `zaf board report <issue> "<body>"` | write your one status comment on an issue; calling again replaces it |
| `zaf board question <issue> "<text>" [--door]` | raise a question for the Engineer; the issue waits |
| `zaf brief <task>` | write the task's pack (ticket, named pages, owned paths, style, this page) and print its path |
| `zaf ask -t <task> "<kind>: <question>" ...` | ask the keeper one to five design questions in one call; kinds are `fact`, `rule`, `term`, `exists`, `where` |
| `zaf asklog` | see the pages cited most, the questions that keep returning, the `not settled` answers |
| `zaf slice open <task>` | open the task's branch and workspace and print both |
| `zaf changes <task> [--path <file>]` | see the task's change: stat first, one file's hunks on request |
| `zaf check <task>` | run the task's checks: the gate, its named tests, its acceptance lines and interfaces (`zaf verify <task>` is the same) |
| `zaf slice pr <task>` | commit what is left, publish the branch, open or update its pull request and print its number |
| `zaf check pr:<n>:<task>` | run the pull request's review steps, wait for them, print the findings; `--status` reads the last result |
| `zaf slice merge <task>` | when the merge conditions hold: merge the base in, gate, push, merge the pull request, mark the task done, remove the workspace |
| `zaf slice drop <task>` | drop the task's workspace; the branch stays |
| `zaf status` | the board, running instances, slots, guard and open questions on one screen |
| `zaf doctor` | validate `ZAF.toml` and the tools it requires |

Asking well:
- Ask everything you have at once: one `zaf ask` carries up to five questions.
- One sentence per question, under thirty words, no code.
- An answer is `settled` (with pages and verbatim quotes), `not settled` or `conflict`.
  `not settled` and `conflict` are not yours to resolve: raise a question on the task.
- A question asked recently is answered from the ask log without a run.
